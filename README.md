# SpaceXLaunch Tracker

A simple Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that displays a list of SpaceX launches.
It fetches data from the [SpaceX REST API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs#rspacex-api-docs) and uses Room for basic offline caching.

This project serves as an exercise to demonstrate the use of modern Android development technologies.
